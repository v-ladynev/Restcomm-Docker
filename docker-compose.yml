      # such, they can share a docker volume for storing recordings (the `recordings` volume). XMS should be configured to store files to that
      # directory. For more complex examples, you'll want to set up NFS shares, etc.


      #  The RestComm docker image supports the same set of environment variables with RestComm, with some prefix, depending on the config file it is in.
      #  - Variables that are located at "restcomm.conf" need to be prefixed with "RCBCONF_"
      #  - Variables that are located at "advanced.conf" need to be prefixed with "RCADVCONF_"
      #  - Variables that are used to configure RMS ("mediaserver.conf") need to be prefixed with "RMSCONF_"
      #  - Variables that are docker specific only need to be prefixed with "EXTCONF_".
      #  - Variables that are used to configure Load Balancer need to be prefixed with "LBCONF_".
      #  - Variables that are set from the RUN command line to overwrite the ones set at the configuration file need to be prefixed with "CLI_".

      #  Docker Specific Environment Variables
      #  ===== RestComm Logs Configuration
      #  * *EXTCONF_RESTCOMM_LOGS* Base path where all RestComm related logs will be placed.
      #  * *EXTCONF_RESTCOMM_TRACE_LOG* Set the location were to store network trace logs (pcap files)
      #  * *EXTCONF_MEDIASERVER_LOGS_LOCATION* Set the location were to store Mediaserver l     og

      #  ===== Other
      #  * *EXTCONF_RVD_PORT* Used when port mapping at docker is not the default (e.g: -p 445:443
